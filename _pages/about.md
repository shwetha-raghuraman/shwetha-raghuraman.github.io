I am an applied microeconomist studying education and inequality. The topics of my research include school choice, multidimensional impacts of schools on students, free tuition program design, and higher education finance. I use experimental, quasi-experimental, and structural methods in my research.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Economics and Business Economics at Aarhus University and a research fellow at TrygFondenâ€™s Centre for Child Research. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Michigan in 2024.
