I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am an applied microeconomist with interests in education and labor.  I use a diverse set of empirical methodologies in my research, including experimental and quasi-experimental methods to evaluate the impacts of education policies, and structural methods from industrial organization to examine the role of education market structure in educational choices. I am on the 2023-2024 job market.
