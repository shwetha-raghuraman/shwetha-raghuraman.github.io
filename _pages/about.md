I am an applied microeconomist with interests in education, labor, and industrial organization. I research how students decide whether and where to attend school, and how this differs by race and socioeconomic status. I use experimental, quasi-experimental, and structural methods to study the implications of different choice environments for these decisions, and how these individual decisions aggregate and form the patterns of segregation and inequality observed in the US education system. I am on the 2023-2024 job market.
