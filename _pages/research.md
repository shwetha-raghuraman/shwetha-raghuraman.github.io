***The Power of Certainty: Experimental Evidence on the Effective Design of Free Tuition Programs*** (with Elizabeth Burland, Susan Dynarski, Katherine Michelmore, and Stephanie Owen). Published in [American Economic Review: Insights][certainty].\
Proposed "free college" policies vary widely in design. The simplest set tuition to zero for everyone. More targeted approaches limit free tuition to those who demonstrate need through an application process. We experimentally test the effects of these two models on the schooling decisions of low-income students. An unconditional free tuition offer from a large public university substantially increases application and enrollment rates. A free tuition offer contingent on proof of need has a much smaller effect on application and none on enrollment. These results are consistent with students placing a high value on financial certainty when making schooling decisions.

## Works in progress
***Mobility and the distributional implications of state divestment in higher education*** (with John Bound, Soyoung Han, and Andrew Simon)\
Declining state investment in public higher education may worsen income and racial inequality if low-income and minority students rely more heavily on in-state options and are less mobile across colleges. In this paper, we study the distributional implications of in- and out-of-state investment in public higher education across individuals and geographies. We first use policy variation in Michigan together with state administrative data to test whether changes in public investment meaningfully affect in-state and out-of-state college enrollment gaps by race and socioeconomic status. We then estimate a structural model of college choice to understand the extent to which differences in mobility and other preferences contribute to potentially differential enrollment responses to public investment, and account for these cross-state and cross-college enrollment responses in measuring the incidence of state higher education investment.
